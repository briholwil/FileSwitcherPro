FileSwitcherPro is a successor of FileSwitcherX.
Users can customize as they wish:
- Automate the replacement of favorite files
- Customize the home screen by arranging only favorite tweaks.
- Freely change the colors of the control center, notifications, dock, and folders.
- Change carrier name and beta alert text.
- Importing a file that has been modified in another app will allow all changes to be applied in just this app.

This app is convenient when used with a file manager.
