# FileSwitcherPro

FileSwitcherPro is a successor of FileSwitcherX.
Users can customize as they wish:

- Customize the home screen by arranging only favorite tweaks.
- Freely change the colors of the control center, notifications, dock, and folders.
- Change carrier name and beta alert text.
- Automatically add padding and adjust size when replacing plist, materialrecipe, or visualstyleset.
- Import files replaced by other tweaking apps (e.g. TrollLock) into this app, so that tweaking can be applied only with this app next time.

This app is convenient when used with a file manager.
